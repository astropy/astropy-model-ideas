Abstract
--------

This document contains:

* A summary of the status of modeling and fitting packages for
  astronomers, focusing on ``astropy.modeling`` and ``Sherpa``.
* Present common modeling / fitting use cases in astronomy,
  with example code in ``astropy-model-ideas``.
* Discuss options how to go forward, i.e. what should / could happen
  to ``astropy.modeling`` and ``Sherpa``.

Given that both ``astropy.modeling`` and ``Sherpa`` exist and won't go away,
the goal is to avoid duplication of effort and improve interoperability.

Why this document?
------------------

At `PyAstro15 <http://python-in-astronomy.github.io/2015/>`__ there were many
discussions on this topic. But they weren't followed up and the status is still
similar now, a year later. In part because there was no consensus what to do,
but in part also because there was no detailed writeup, action items and
follow-up meetings.

It is an attempt to summarise the discussions at `PyAstro16
<http://python-in-astronomy.github.io/2016/>`__, and to do better this time,
i.e. come up with a good solution and make sure it gets implemented in the
coming months.

This document doesn't present a concrete and complete plan yet that needs
approval. It's not clear if we should submit this as an `Astropy APE
<https://github.com/astropy/astropy-APEs>`__.

For now, please contribute to this document and code examples to
https://github.com/astropy/astropy-model-ideas.
